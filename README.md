# Harry Potter Trivia Game
Online Trivia Quiz

As you can see, this is an online trivia game based on the popular Harry Potter franchise. It is a fairly remarkable feat of ES5, vanilla JavaScript, and DOM traversal. It’s also a lot of fun! Players can choose between 2- or 4-minute games.  The goal is to answer as many questions correctly within that time interval.  Each wrong answer will deduct 15 seconds from your remaining time.  Players can store their high scores in the browser’s local storage for comparison.
